    "### Intuition of the Bag of Words (BoW) Text Vectorization Model\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creating a word dictionary**: First, we create a list of all the words that appear in all text documents. This list can be considered a \"dictionary\" or \"universe\" of all words found in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Transforming a document into a vector**: Each document is transformed into a vector, where each element corresponds to the number of occurrences of a specific word from this dictionary in the document. If a word appears in the document 3 times, its corresponding value will be 3; if it does not appear at all, it will be 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://vitalflux.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Bag-of-words-technique-to-convert-to-numerical-feature-vector-png.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is effective if we simply want to count words, but it has a number of limitations that can affect the results of text analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Issues with the Bag of Words (BoW) Method\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dimensionality of vectors**: If you have a large dataset with many documents, the dictionary will contain a huge number of unique words. This leads to very large vectors that are difficult to process and store. This problem is known as the \"curse of dimensionality.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Frequent but insignificant words (stop words)**: Some words (such as \"and,\" \"but,\" \"this\") appear very frequently across all documents but do not have much meaning for classification or analysis. In BoW, these words can have a high weight even if they do not carry semantic content.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Rare but important words**: Conversely, some words may appear only in one document but be important for classification or understanding the content. For example, terms specific to a certain topic or document. In BoW, these words may have the same weight as less important words, which reduces the quality of the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Multiple forms of words**: One word can have many different forms (e.g., \"go,\" \"gone,\" \"going\" or \"bird\" and \"birds\"). In BoW, all these forms will be treated as different words, increasing dimensionality and complicating analysis. This makes the model less robust to different forms of the same word."

    "### Tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenization is the process of breaking text into smaller units called tokens. Tokens can be individual words, phrases, or even characters.  \n",
    "The goal of tokenization is to transform text into a structure that is convenient for further analysis and processing by NLP models. For example, the sentence \"NLP is fun!\" can be tokenized into [\"NLP\", \"is\", \"fun\", \"!\"].  \n",
    "Tokenization allows each word or character to be considered as a separate unit for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the nltk library here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)** library is one of the most popular libraries for natural language processing in Python. It offers a wide range of tools and resources for exploring and building NLP models.  \n",
    "Link: https://www.nltk.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of the NLTK library\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tokenization**\n",
    " - Tools for breaking text into sentences or words (tokens). This includes basic tokenization methods based on spaces and punctuation, as well as more advanced methods to support different languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Stemming and Lemmatization**\n",
    "   - Support for various algorithms for stemming (e.g., the Porter algorithm, the Lancaster algorithm) and lemmatization (e.g., using WordNet dictionaries). These tools help normalize words to their base or root forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Stop Words Removal**\n",
    "   - A built-in list of stop words for various languages and tools for removing them from text to focus on more meaningful terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Frequency Analysis**\n",
    "   - Tools for counting the frequency of words and n-grams (sequences of n words) in text, which is useful for text analysis and identifying key terms or phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Part of Speech (POS) Tagging**\n",
    "   - The ability to automatically determine the parts of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) for each word in the text using built-in taggers (e.g., Perceptron Tagger, Maximum Entropy Tagger).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**\n",
    "   - Tools for automatically identifying named entities in text, such as people, organizations, places, and other categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Modeling Sentence Grammar Structure**\n",
    "   - Tools for parsing sentences and constructing syntactic trees that show the grammatical structure of the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Processing and Analyzing Text Corpora**\n",
    "   - Built-in text corpora for training and testing NLP models, such as the \"Brown Corpus,\" \"Reuters Corpus,\" \"Movie Reviews,\" as well as interfaces to external resources like WordNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Machine Learning Algorithms for NLP**\n",
    "   - The ability to use various machine learning algorithms (e.g., naive Bayes, decision trees) to solve NLP tasks such as text classification or sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Building n-gram Models**\n",
    "    - Tools for creating models based on n-grams, which are used for predicting the next words or analyzing sequences in text.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Data Visualization**\n",
    "    - Tools for creating frequency plots of words, parse trees, and other visualizations for a deeper understanding of text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Interfaces for Other Libraries**\n",
    "    - Integration with other libraries and resources, such as WordNet, TextBlob, and other NLP tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of using NLTK:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ease of Use:** NLTK has a simple and user-friendly interface for beginners in NLP, as well as a well-documented API.\n",
    "- **Large Community:** NLTK has a large community of users and developers, which facilitates quick problem-solving and experience sharing.\n",
    "- **Educational Resource:** With its rich documentation and numerous examples, NLTK is a popular choice for teaching natural language processing in universities and online courses."

    "# TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "Another method of vectorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) is a way to determine the importance of a word in a text, particularly in a set of texts (documents). Imagine you are reading many articles and want to understand which words are the most important in each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Term Frequency (TF)**: This is the frequency with which a word appears in the text. For example, if the word \"car\" appears 3 times in an article of 100 words, then its TF = 3/100 = 0.03. TF shows how often a word is used in a specific document.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: This is a measure that indicates how rare a word is across all documents. If the word \"car\" appears in all documents, its importance decreases. IDF is calculated as the logarithm of the ratio of the total number of documents to the number of documents where the word appears. If a word appears in many documents, its IDF will be low.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **TF-IDF**: Combines both measures — TF and IDF — to find words that frequently appear in a specific document but rarely in others. Such words are considered more important for understanding the content of a specific document.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:816/1*Cp46FtVZPkQANjdwmwr3fg.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, TF-IDF helps filter out words that are not very important to the content of the text (for example, \"and\", \"or\", \"this\") and focus on key terms that have greater significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of calculation\n",
    "![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4D12AQF8sI1V68UsIQ/article-cover_image-shrink_600_2000/0/1677509695129?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=pDHLFUdBEFMD3q6K0eNgg_C_zPYYYxikomIN00cfTuo)"

    "\n",
    "1. **Ignores the importance of words**: In BoW, all words have the same weight, regardless of how often they appear in different documents. For example, the words \"and\", \"in\", \"or\" will be considered as important as the key words of the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Does not take into account the overall frequency of the word**: In BoW, we do not consider whether a word appears frequently in many documents, and therefore it may not carry significant semantic weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TF-IDF** addresses these issues by adding weight to words based on their frequency in a specific document and rarity across the entire set of documents. This makes TF-IDF more effective for highlighting important words and reducing the significance of commonly used words that do not carry much semantic load.\n",
